{"name":"Komenco-docker-base","tagline":"","body":"komenco base containers\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nkomenco is using docker containers to run everything from production\r\nto development, even the tests are executed in a docker container. To\r\nbe ease the creation of application specific docker containers we\r\nprovide a couple of base containers that can be extended.\r\n\r\nIn standard setups the base container is extended to contain your\r\napplication and the other containers (test, simpleid, selenium) are\r\nused as is.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites ###\r\n\r\nThe following software is required on your system:\r\n\r\n* [docker](https://www.docker.com/)\r\n* [docker-composer](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)\r\n\r\nMany of the major distributions provide packages for docker, but as they are not\r\nnecessarily providing the latest versions of docker we recommend that you follow\r\nthe installation instructions on the docker website.\r\n\r\ndocker-compose can be currently installed via pip. Please see the\r\ndocker-compose page for up-to-date installation instructions for your system.\r\n\r\n### Building the containers ###\r\n\r\nAfter checking out this repository build the base containers by\r\nrunning the build script\r\n\r\n    ./build.sh\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under the MIT license.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
